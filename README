Yo! Thanks for downloading phyphy. This program is designed to simulate physical phenomenon according to
old physics. I believe that this program helps students to understand how fun physics is! ....maybe?

You can see documantation of this app from here 'http://leotom.890m.com/cowboy/apps/phyphy.html'
Phyphy is open sourced program. you can see and compile source code from the file that this foulder contains.

You may redistribute this application with or without moddifying it. And you may redistribute it under the lisence
whatever you want to use.
If you dont mind I want you to link my website 'http://leotom.890m.com/' when you redistribute it.
I wont force ya to do so cuz I know dat no one is gonna redistribute it anyways...

Anyway! Enjoy your experience of physics!!

This application uses ini4j library which you can download from here 'http://ini4j.sourceforge.net/' 
You will need it to compile source code.
